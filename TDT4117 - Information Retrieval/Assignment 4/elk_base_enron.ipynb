The April contract climbed $0.043 to $2.19 per MMBtu. The\\nmarket opened higher on colder weather across much of the nation, but\\ndipped below $2.10 briefly in the early afternoon before short-covering\\nboosted prices before the close, holding in a $0.055 range. Funds were\\nbuying early with the cold weather keeping the sellers at bay. Look for\\nthe cold weather to drive the market to test $2.15 resistance today, with\\na good chance of testing the $2.21 level. The market is still bottom\\nbuilding, moving quietly in a sideways range, causing any short-covering\\nrally to be met with selling into resistance. With winter ending soon and\\na Tcf in excess storage, the gravitational pull on the market is\\ntremendous. The withdrawals over the last several weeks have been larger\\nthan just pure weather-related withdrawals, so a marginal amount of\\nnatural gas coming out storage is supplementing daily production in the\\nmarket. The estimated volume was 69,100 contracts, with 34,800 of those\\nhedges or spreads. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and\\nCanada was generally $0.05 - $0.15 higher yesterday on short-term cold\\nweather in the Midwest to the Northeast, forcing price squeezes at certain\\npipelines on marketers who were short to begin the new month. The trend\\nfor this month is still softer cash prices. Natural gas for next day\\ndelivery at the Henry hub gained $0.07 to $2.14 per MMBtu.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n Exploit the enterprise-wide transaction management power deployed by the\\nbig names in gas.\\nNUCLEUS Software\\nZAINET Gasmaster\\nThe most comprehensive, totally-integrated natural gas information system\\navailable today.\\nAsk about out limited-time offer competitive upgrade program.\\nCAMINUS\\nYour Competitive Edge in Energy.\\nCall Caminus at (212)515-3700 or visit the website at\\nhttp://www.caminus.com\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nToday\\'s Power Bulletins\\n * Ice Storm Sweeps Across Midwest Knocking Out Power for One Million\\nCustomers\\n * DQE Reports 4th Quarter Loss as Company Takes $78.3 Million Charge\\n * Report Says Price Cap Had Little Impact on California Power Prices\\n * Ontario Chooses BMO Nesbitt Burns, Goldman Sachs and RBC Dominion\\nSecurities as Joint Underwriters to Take Hydro One Public in C$5 Billion\\nIPO\\n * Calpine Reports 23% Drop in 4th Quarter Earnings Due to Weak Wholesale\\nPower Prices\\n * Mirant Shares Fall 6.5% Yesterday After Spending Plans Cut\\n * El Paso Energy Files $1 Billion Debt Securities Shelf\\n * AEP to Invest $7 Million to Address Community Concerns Over Plume\\nAppearance at Gavin Plant\\n * Duke Energy Sells Duke Engineering & Services\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nDO YOU JUST SEE TREES?

The group filed a\\ncomplaint last April, during the height of the crisis, when wholesale\\npower prices had galloped 10 times higher and customers were hit with a\\nseries of rolling blackouts. The group accused BPA, Canada\\'s BC Hydro,\\nPowerex and Mirant of withholding wholesale power supplies to boost prices\\nduring the crisis. The BPA, which supplies about half of the Pacific\\nNorthwest\\'s power through huge hydropower dams, is owned by the federal\\ngovernment. BC Hydro is owned by the provincial government of British\\nColumbia.

The system, valued at $2.7 billion,\\nruns 16,600 miles from Texas to the Great Lakes. Enron had contested the\\ntakeover after Dynegy backed out of its plan to buy Enron for $23 billion\\nin November. Earlier this month, Enron gave up the pipeline, but is\\nproceeding with a $10 billion lawsuit against Dynegy for terminating their\\ndeal. Northern Natural has a capacity of 4.3 Bcf of natural gas per day\\nand has valuable connection points with other pipelines. Although Dynegy\\noperates many pipelines, Northern Natural is their first foray into\\npipeline ownership. Dynegy paid $23 million to complete the purchase and\\nnamed Daniel Dienstbier as the systems president, a position he held\\nbefore becoming president of Enron\\'s Gas Pipeline Group in 1985. Dynegy\\nalso assumed $900 million of Northern Natural\\'s debt. Enron employees will\\nrun and maintain Northern Natural until Enron\\'s option to buy it back\\nexpires June 30th. But most think that is unlikely to happen, given\\nEnron\\'s current state of affairs.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nENERGY.\\n@ENERGY(r), FEA\\'s Complete Suite of Energy Products,\\nBUILT FOR THE FUTURE.\\n\\n*Manage all your energy risks.\\n*Build and Price deals.\\n*Value physical assets (generation, storage, etc.)\\n*Report and reduce your energy risks\\n\\nFEA\\nFINANCIAL ENGINEERING ASSOCIATES Inc.\\nhttp://www.fea.com/?cId=17\\nmain phone number:  1 510-548-6200\\nemail address: info@fea.com\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nPHYSICAL POWER PRICES\\n|            | High  |  Low  | Average |\\n|            | $/MWh | $/MWh |  $/MWh  |\\n| Cinergy    | 21.00 | 19.00 |  19.40  |\\n| ECAR       | 22.25 | 16.50 |  20.25  |\\n| ERCOT      | 21.00 | 18.50 |  19.10  |\\n| Entergy    | 19.00 | 17.00 |  18.35  |\\n| TVA        | 23.00 | 20.15 |  22.55  |\\n| ComEd      | 20.25 | 19.75 |  20.10  |\\n| Nepool     | 29.50 | 29.25 |  29.30  |\\n| PJM West   | 22.75 | 21.75 |  22.00  |\\n| Main       | 20.25 | 18.00 |  19.55  |\\n| MAPP       | 21.25 | 19.00 |  20.40  |\\n| Palo Verde | 26.50 | 23.50 |  24.95  |\\n| Mid C      | 21.00 | 19.00 |  19.60  |\\n| COB        | 24.00 | 22.00 |  22.60  |\\n| 4 Corners  | 24.25 | 23.25 |  23.90  |\\n| Mead       | 25.75 | 24.00 |  24.95  |\\n| NP 15      | 27.00 | 24.00 |  24.80  |\\n| SP 15      | 27.50 | 24.00 |  25.35  |\\n             Power Delivered 2/1\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nFERC Approves Tuscarora Pipeline Expansion\\n\\n\\n    The  has given final approval to Tuscarora Gas Transmission\\'s plan to\\nexpand its pipeline system to bring more natural gas to industrial\\ncustomers in northern Nevada.

One\\nCalifornia senator also demanded that the FERC provide a list of meetings\\nand telephone calls between the commission and Enron executives from\\nAugust 2000 through June 2001. Enron has denied any wrongdoing. The\\nDemocratic senator pointed to news reports that former Enron chairman Ken\\nLay met with Vice President Cheney in April, 2001 and discussed the\\nCalifornia power crisis. The next day, Cheney said he opposed price caps,\\nthe senator said. The senator is questioning whether Enron used influence\\nin secret meetings with the vice president or the FERC to persuade them to\\ndo nothing about the state\\'s soaring power prices. However, the\\nadministration has always opposed price caps. But the FERC chairman said\\nthat his staff has already started to look into the allegations. The probe\\nwill involve FERC\\'s office of general counsel and office of market tariffs\\nand rates. The chairman declined to elaborate on the scope of the probe.\\nThe legislators cited a study by an independent consultant showing that\\nCalifornia prices fell by 30% soon after Enron declared bankruptcy in\\nDecember. The Democrats say that a key factor in higher power prices was\\nEnron\\'s dealings in unregulated financial derivatives in the natural gas\\nmarket while controlling a large share of the market.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nR.

In Oklahoma,\\nthe governor declared a state of emergency in 28 of the state\\'s 77\\ncounties. The storm may leave some customers without power for up to a\\nweek. Freezing rain and ice downed power lines and snapped trees around\\nOklahoma, leaving more than 230,000 customers without electricity with\\ntemperatures in the low 20s. Oklahoma Gas & Electric said it was the worst\\nstorm in the 100-year history of the company in terms of customers\\naffected. Yesterday evening, about 176,000 OG&E customers still had no\\nelectricity, about 123,000 of them in Oklahoma City. The utility said at\\nleast 60 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, ranging from 69 kV to\\n345 kV, were on the ground, but it has been able to reroute power around\\nthe downed transmission lines. Kansas City was also hit by the worst ice\\nstorm in 16 years, with more than 100,000 customers without power. Repair\\ncrews from other areas were being brought in to clear downed trees and\\nrestore electricity. Kansas City Power & Light had 90 line crews and 100\\ntree crews working around the clock. KCP&L said as many as 285,000\\ncustomers were without power overnight. In the upper Midwest, the storm\\nknocked out power to almost 100,000 customers in southern Michigan, but\\ndid not damage the high-voltage transmission grid in Michigan.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nEnergy Seminars, Inc.

The FERC began requiring monthly California price data\\nfrom natural gas sellers and pipelines last July during the state\\'s power\\ncrisis. Last summer, natural gas prices oared above $18 per MMBtu in the\\nstate\\'s spot market while other US prices remained much lower. However,\\nthe commission indicated that it might require other kinds of energy\\npricing data to be reported on a regular basis. The decision to drop the\\nreporting was supported by energy companies which said the requirement was\\ncostly and burdensome.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n           Progas Storage and Services, Inc.\\n\\nProgas can custom build gas storage in the Upper Midwest.\\n\\n?

The\\ngovernor and PUC argued over options for repaying the bonds after the\\nregulator rejected an initial proposal in October. Bond proceeds would be\\nused to cover the state\\'s cost of buying electricity for utilities that\\nran up billions of dollars in debt under the state\\'s deregulation law. The\\nPUC has issued a proposed plan that would let the state Department of\\nWater Resources sell the bonds.  The state has spent $11.8 billion buying\\nelectricity. Comments on the plan are due by February 5th and the FERC\\nexpects to vote on the agreement at a February 21st meeting. But it may be\\nvery difficult to sell the bonds by June 30th, even if a plan is approved\\nsoon.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\\nThe TSE 300 gained 99.66 points to 7648.49\\nThe CRB Index climbed 0.36 points to 187.29\\nThe US Dollar increased 0.54 points to 120.16\\nThe Dow advanced 157.00 points to 9920.00\\nThe S&P 500 climbed 16.63 points to 1130.20\\nThe Nasdaq was up 20.59 points to 1934.03\\nMarch NYMEX Crude Oil added 0.40 to 19.48\\nCanadian-US Exchange rose 0.0009 to 1.5923\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nENERGY MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE\\nHigher Education for refined product professionals\\nNOW ENROLLING RISK MANAGEMENT COURSES: PROFESSIONAL GASOLINE AND\\nDISTILLATE\\nMANAGEMENT, PETROLEUM MARKETER, and  ADVANCED GASOLINE AND DISTILLATE\\nMASTER\\nLEVEL.\\nREGISTER NOW, CLASS SIZES ARE LIMITED.\\nSEE COMPLETE DETAILS CLICK HERE :http://www.energyinstitution.org\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nPure Text, Lotus, AOL, Yahoo, Excite, Readers-subscribe by writing to:\\nenerfax-subscribe@egroups.com\\n\\nOutlook Email Readers-subscribe to webmail by writing to:\\nmailto:join-EnerfaxDaily@relay.netatlantic.com\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nTo view past issues of Enerfax Daily -Sign up for free at  Divine\\'s\\nSagewave at\\nhttp://www.sagewave.com/D2/autolog/common/log.asp?KEY=enerfax\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nPlease welcome our advertisers by visiting these websites.\\nhttp://www.e-acumen.com\\nhttp://www.kwi.com/\\nhttp://www.fea.com/\\nhttp://www.caminus.com/\\nhttp://www.progas.net/wip\\nhttp://www.ziffenergyconferences.com/\\nhttp://www.energyseminars.com\\nhttp://www.desert-crossing.com\\nhttp://www.epis.com\\nhttp://www.rwbeck.com\\nhttp://www.NewEnergyAssoc.com\\n\\nenerfaxtext, forward to delete@enerfax.com to unsubscribe.', 'timestamp': '2022-10-17T09:55:14.049049'}}, {'_index': 'enron-index-000001', '_id': '4730', '_score': 0.0, '_ignored': ['text.keyword'], '_source': {'text': 'Message-ID: <20840647.1075841970374.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\\nDate: Mon, 7 Jan 2002 11:50:30 -0800 (PST)\\nFrom: victor.lamadrid@enron.com\\nTo: l..kelly@enron.com, chuck.ames@enron.com, f..brawner@enron.com, \\n\\tchris.germany@enron.com, f..keavey@enron.com, brad.mckay@enron.com, \\n\\tjonathan.mckay@enron.com, scott.neal@enron.com, \\n\\tandrea.ring@enron.com, maureen.smith@enron.com, \\n\\tcraig.taylor@enron.com, judy.townsend@enron.com, \\n\\tfrank.vickers@enron.com\\nSubject: FW: Market Area IT Availability - January 9, 2002\\nCc: lia.halstead@enron.com, donna.greif@enron.com, robert.allwein@enron.com, \\n\\tl..driscoll-ernest@enron.com, clarissa.garcia@enron.com, \\n\\tscott.goodell@enron.com, meredith.homco@enron.com, \\n\\tscott.loving@enron.com, chris.ordway@enron.com, \\n\\tchristina.sanchez@enron.com, robert.superty@enron.com, \\n\\tvictoria.versen@enron.com\\nMime-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain;

Former CFO\\nAndrew Fastow and several board members including external director\\nHerbert Winokur Jr were also at the meeting that discussed Enron\\'s\\npartnership Chewco, named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca. Chewco,\\nwhich was supposed to be completely independent, but was run and partly\\nowned by Enron executive Michael Kopper, who also attended the meeting.\\nFederal investigators and private litigants are trying to find out who\\nknew what about Chewco and when. An attorney for Winokur says the\\nexecutive committee was told that Chewco was a special-purpose vehicle not\\naffiliated with the company. The board never waived the\\nconflict-of-interest policy for Kopper nor was the board told that Kopper\\nwas involved with Chewco.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nFAST.

There was\\nalso failures in the performance of Enron\\'s outside advisors. And there\\nwas a fundamental default of leadership and management, starting with\\nformer CEO Ken Lay and reaching to the board and senior managers. As\\nCongress begins a week of hearings, the House Financial Services capital\\nmarkets subcommittee also heard from SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt. Powers\\njoined the Enron board to investigate events leading up to the company\\nfiling for bankruptcy on December 2nd. He has issued a 218-page report\\nthat found Enron fattened its profits by almost $1 billion through a web\\nof financial partnerships used to hide losses, while top managers made\\nmillions of dollars they should never have received. He laid some of the\\nblame for on Lay and of Jeffrey Skilling. Powers said former ex-Enron CFO\\nAndrew Fastow made at least $30 million, while former senior executive\\nMichael Kopper made at least $10 million through their involvement in\\noff-the-books partnerships. Enron\\'s board of directors failed in its duty\\nto provide leadership and oversight and in the end, the tragedy could and\\nshould have been avoided, Powers said. After the report was released, Lay\\ncanceled plans to testify before a Senate committee and before the capital\\nmarkets subcommittee.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nENERGY.\\n@ENERGY(r), FEA\\'s Complete Suite of Energy Products,\\nBUILT FOR THE FUTURE.\\n\\n*Manage all your energy risks.\\n*Build and Price deals.\\n*Value physical assets (generation, storage, etc.)\\n*Report and reduce your energy risks\\n\\nFEA\\nFINANCIAL ENGINEERING ASSOCIATES Inc.\\nwww.fea.com/?cId=18\\nJennifer Cogley\\n Marketing Department\\n Financial Engineering Associates\\n 2201 Dwight Way\\n Berkeley, CA 94704\\n www.fea.com\\n mailto:jennifer.cogley@fea.com\\n T. +1 510-549-8702x209\\n F. +1 510-548-0332\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nPHYSICAL POWER PRICES\\n|            | High  |  Low  | Average |\\n|            | $/MWh | $/MWh |  $/MWh  |\\n| Cinergy    | 24.00 | 20.15 |  21.90  |\\n| ECAR       | 23.00 | 19.00 |  20.40  |\\n| ERCOT      | 21.00 | 18.50 |  19.10  |\\n| Entergy    | 21.05 | 20.00 |  20.50  |\\n| TVA        | 24.00 | 21.00 |  22.55  |\\n| ComEd      | 23.50 | 21.50 |  22.60  |\\n| Nepool     | 30.80 | 29.80 |  30.15  |\\n| PJM West   | 22.75 | 21.75 |  22.00  |\\n| Main       | 23.25 | 20.00 |  22.15  |\\n| MAPP       | 23.75 | 20.25 |  22.30  |\\n| Palo Verde | 24.00 | 23.00 |  23.75  |\\n| Mid C      | 21.00 | 19.00 |  19.60  |\\n| COB        | 24.00 | 22.00 |  22.60  |\\n| 4 Corners  | 24.25 | 23.25 |  23.90  |\\n| Mead       | 25.75 | 24.00 |  24.95  |\\n| NP 15      | 25.25 | 23.50 |  24.25  |\\n| SP 15      | 25.25 | 23.50 |  24.45  |\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nAEP May Sell Some Foreign Assets\\n\\n\\n    American Electric Power may sell Seeboard, which serves 2 million\\npower and natural gas users in the UK, and CitiPower, an Australian retail\\nand distribution unit, to lower debt as it switches its focus to wholesale\\nmarkets and away from household power supply.

AEP, which acquired Seeboard in a $10 billion buyout\\nof C&SW, said will consider all potential options for Seeboard. AEP\\'s 4th\\nquarter earnings fell 41% due to mild weather. It is selling common stock\\nand convertible preferred shares to raise cash and shore up its balance\\nsheet. Last year, AEP sold Yorkshire Power in the UK and purchased 2 power\\nstations. AEP has also been expanding its energy trading business after\\nEnrons collapse. It bought Enron\\'s Scandinavian businesses and hired 22\\ncoal traders from Enron. Seeboard is likely to fetch a good price since it\\nis the only supply business for sale in the UK. E.ON, Electricite de\\nFrance and Scottish & Southern Energy have been named as likely bidders\\nfor Seeboard. CitiPowers sale will probably happen in the 3rd quarter,\\naccording to AEP. Possible buyers could be Australian Gas Light, United\\nEnergy and Origin Energy. AEP bought the retail and distribution company\\nfor $1.1 billion in 1998.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nOPEN SEASON\\n\\nSG Resources Mississippi, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGR\\nHoldings, L.L.C., is conducting an open season for firm storage services\\nat its new high-deliverability, salt cavern, natural gas storage facility,\\nknown as the Southern Pines Energy Center.

Williams said that those costs will be included in the 4th quarter\\nearnings report. Williams Energy Partners which is 60% owned by Williams\\nhas been mentioned as a likely buyer for the pipeline. Williams has sold\\nsecurities and cut capital spending to shore up its balance sheet amid\\nheavier scrutiny by credit rating agencies following Enron\\'s bankruptcy.\\nWilliams\\' 7.5% coupon bonds maturing in 2031 were down about $44 to $879\\nper $1,000 face value from $923 last week, with the spread above US\\nTreasuries climbing to 330 basis points from 285. None of the rating\\nagencies has downgraded Williams debt yet, but S&P has says it may lower\\nWilliams\\' ratings because of concern about the company\\'s finances. S&P\\nrates Williams \\'BBB+\\', Moody\\'s rates it \\'Baa2\\' and Fitch rates it as\\n\\'BBB\\', all investment grade. Williams is aiming complete the Midwest\\npipeline sale by the end of the 2nd quarter. Net income for Williams\\nEnergy Partners more climbed to $21.7 million from $3 million a year ago.\\nIt also  raised quarterly payment to unit holders by 12% to $0.59. The\\npossible purchase of the Midwest pipeline could be financed through a\\ncombination of debt and equity, Williams Energy Partners said. The\\npartnership has $140 million in private debt. Williams said its 4th\\nquarter loss had widened and its banks have warned that the it may be in\\ndefault of their credit agreements. Williams\\' stock dropped 13.9%\\nyesterday, down 2.64 to 16.36.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nR. W.

As long as the\\nmarket was able to continue trading above the previous day\\'s low, that\\nadvance worked well,\" noted Dean Hazelcorn, trader with Coquest, Dallas.\\n\"Today looks like a sell signal. The high of the March contract did not\\nexceed Friday\\'s high and today\\'s low was lower. That sets up a trade down\\nto $1.97. I look for a slow deteriorating front end of the board,\" he\\nnoted.  \"I\\'m back in a bearish mode, and I think we\\'re headed below $2.00.\\nI believe that there is a 99% probability the market will work lower, but\\nit may take 3 months to do it,\" he cautioned.  Other traders are more\\noptimistic.  \"Longer term I\\'m bullish,\" says John Beaver, President\\nPrivate Futures Group, Oklahoma City.  \"It\\'s more difficult to be bullish\\non the front of the board, but looking at the charts it suggests that\\nprices may be set to rise.  There\\'s a gap on the weekly chart between\\n$2.17 and $2.20 on the weekly chart (week ending January 18, and January\\n25). and if prices could fill that gap, it would be a positive sign that\\nprices were set to move higher,\" he said.  A gap is a pattern on the price\\ncharts followed by market technicians. The idea is that the gap may act as\\na barrier to (in this case) further price advances. Once the gap is\\n\"filled\", however, a potential limitation to price advances has been\\nremoved and prices would be empowered to move higher.  \"I don\\'t have any\\ninterest in being short the market at the $2.00 level. I don\\'t want to be\\nin a trade that may only make 10 or 15 cents and have to worry about it,\"\\nhe said.  \"If you are a commercial trader are you going to get short at\\n$1.85? What is your board of directors going to say?\"\\nMore observations and market forecasts in GasTrader Newsletter.

The March contract lost $0.004 to\\n$2.261 per MMBtu. With short-covering from locals and funds in the front\\nand trade buying in the back months, the market reached $2.35 by\\nmid-afternoon but then quickly sold off late in the session. The technical\\nbuying on what was being termed an oversold market came in late morning as\\nlocals and funds tried to cover positions, then punched in buy-stops into\\nthe mid-$2.30 before corporate trading houses took profits and sold down\\nthe contract late. It turned out to be a long day\\'s journey to just about\\nnowhere. Look for the market drop lower early today as yesterday\\'s late\\nsell-off continues. However, the AGA is expected to report higher\\nwithdrawal tomorrow afternoon than in recent weeks. Early predictions are\\nfor a withdrawal of about  150 - 160 Bcf, compared to 167 Bcf a year ago.\\nThe 5-year average for the week is 118 Bcf.

That case involved 650 people who were paid $333 million by\\nPG&E to settle claims they drank water containing chromium six, a\\npotential cause of cancer, near a Hinkley, CA natural gas pipeline station\\nowned by PG&E. The new claims involve 1,250 people seeking $500 million\\nfor alleged personal injuries that are pending in 15 lawsuits involving\\nchromium at PG&E\\'s Kettleman, Topock and Hinkley pipeline stations. PG&E\\nhas said its potential liability is $160 million. Chromium six was used at\\nthe pipeline stations in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent the pumps\\' cooling\\nsystems from rusting then dumped in unlined ponds near the stations.\\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs say the chromium seeped into underground\\nwater supplies and caused a number of illnesses, including cancer.\\nAlthough PG&E has said it used the chemical, it denies that chromium has\\ncaused the illnesses. PG&E attorneys have said that bankruptcy law\\nmandates that personal injury and wrongful death claims be moved to a US\\ndistrict court to ensure that the claims are handled as quickly and fairly\\nas possible. Plaintiffs attorneys contend that the suits were filed long\\nbefore the utility filed for bankruptcy and that moving them now to a\\nfederal court would prolong the cases.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nPOWER FUTURES\\n| Month |   COB   | Change |   PV    | Change  |\\n| FEB   |  24.75  | +0.00  |  24.75  |  +0.00  |\\n| MAR   |  22.00  | +0.00  |  22.00  |  +0.00  |\\n| APR   |  21.25  | +0.00  |  21.25  |  +0.00  |\\n| MAY   |  23.20  | +0.00  |  23.30  |  +0.00  |\\n| JUN   |  22.00  | +0.00  |  22.00  |  +0.00  |\\n| JUL   |  34.75  | +0.00  |  34.75  |  +0.00  |\\n| AUG   |  44.00  | +0.00  |  44.00  |  +0.00  |\\n| SEP   |  39.75  | +0.00  |  39.75  |  +0.00  |\\n| OCT   |  30.75  | +0.00  |  30.75  |  +0.00  |\\n| NOV   |  33.00  | +0.00  |  30.00  |  +0.00  |\\n| DEC   |  35.00  | +0.00  |  30.00  |  +0.00  |\\n| JAN   |  33.00  | +0.00  |  30.75  |  +0.00  |\\n| Month | Entergy | Change | Cinergy | Change  |\\n| FEB   |  21.70  | +0.00  |  23.60  |  +0.00  |\\n| MAR   |  21.75  | +0.00  |  23.70  |  +0.00  |\\n| APR   |  21.75  | +0.00  |  23.70  |  +0.00  |\\n| MAY   |  24.50  | +0.00  |  26.75  |  +0.00  |\\n| JUN   |  31.75  | +0.00  |  35.50  |  +0.00  |\\n| JUL   |  41.00  | +0.00  |  46.00  |  +0.00  |\\n| AUG   |  41.00  | +0.00  |  46.00  |  +0.00  |\\n| SEP   |  22.50  | +0.00  |  24.75  |  +0.00  |\\n| OCT   |  22.75  | +0.00  |  24.75  |  +0.00  |\\n| NOV   |  22.75  | +0.00  |  24.75  |  +0.00  |\\n| DEC   |  22.75  | +0.00  |  24.75  |  +0.00  |\\n| JAN   |  26.00  | +0.00  |  27.00  |  +0.00  |\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nPower Futures\\n| Month |  PJM  | Change |\\n| FEB   | 27.55 | +0.00  |\\n| MAR   | 26.10 | +0.00  |\\n| APR   | 26.10 | +0.00  |\\n| MAY   | 29.50 | +0.00  |\\n| JUN   | 38.25 | +0.00  |\\n| JUL   | 52.50 | +0.00  |\\n| AUG   | 52.50 | +0.00  |\\n| SEP   | 26.50 | +0.00  |\\n| OCT   | 25.50 | +0.00  |\\n| NOV   | 25.50 | +0.00  |\\n| DEC   | 25.50 | +0.00  |\\n| JAN   | 30.00 | +0.00  |\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nMackenzie Delta Natural Gas Project Files for Approval\\n\\n   A consortium of major oil companies have moved closer to developing\\nalmost 6 Tcf of natural gas in the Mackenzie Delta region on the coast of\\nthe Beaufort Sea. The group has begun the lengthy process of applying for\\nregulatory approval, which could take up to 4 years. Led by Imperial Oil,\\nthe group consists of Conoco, Shell Canada, Exxon Mobil and now includes a\\ncompany controlled by Northwest Territories native people. The partners,\\nknown as the Mackenzie Valley Producers Group, could spend up to C$250\\nmillion before they decide whether to proceed with the project. The\\nnatural gas reserves would be produced from Imperial\\'s 3 Tcf Taglu field,\\nthe 1.8 Tcf Parsons Lake field, owned by Conoco and Exxon Mobil, and\\nShell\\'s 1 Tcf Niglintgak field. The project would include a pipeline to\\ncarry up to 1 Bcf per day of natural gas to Alberta along the Mackenzie\\nRiver valley at a estimated cost of C$3 billion. The natural gas would\\nthen be transported to Canada and the US. Last year, the group signed an\\nagreement with Northwest Territories native leaders that would give the\\nregion\\'s people a 33% share in the pipeline and provide other economic\\nbenefits. Even if the Mackenzie Delta project did not start pumping for 5\\nor 6 years, it likely will still be ahead of the Alaskan project, where\\nBP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips are planning development of their reserves.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nEnergy Seminars, Inc.

In a survey by Inside FERC\\'s Gas Market\\nReport, the average price of natural gas delivered to the premium New York\\nand New Jersey markets for January was $4.92 per MMBtu compared with $3.12\\nper MMBtu in December and $19.33 per MMBtu last January. In Southern\\nCalifornia, the monthly average reached a high of $16.39 per MMBtu in\\nJanuary 2001, the average monthly spot price for January 2002 climbed to\\n$2.62 per MMBtu, up 15.4% from $2.27 per MMBtu in December. The January\\naverage is 84% below the January 2001 level. Monthly spot prices for\\nJanuary climbed higher because weather was cold across most of the nation\\nat the close of December when most of the January deal making was\\nhappening and because forecasts for the first part of January were for\\nmore of the same. On January 4th, the average price for futures contracts\\nfor the coming 12 months was $2.569 per MMBtu, down 9.25% from the $2.831\\naverage on December 4th and 51% from the $5.241 average on April 4, 2001.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n                Progas Storage Services, Inc\\n\\nWas recently organized to offer specialized natural gas storage services\\nto marketers and end users servicing the upper Midwest and Northeast\\nmarket regions along the major transmission systems in Indiana, Illinois,\\nKentucky, and Michigan.

Last Novermber, the FERC introduced a new\\nstandard for sizing up market power for utilities big enough to influence\\nenergy prices in their areas. The plan has raised a storm of protest from\\nmany utilities. The proposed new market power test is based on the peak\\npower demand in any given area. If a company controls generation in any\\narea greater than its peak demand, FERC would require it to base rates on\\nper-unit production costs, not market-based rates. The previous\\nmarket-power test was any firm controlling more than 20% of supplies could\\nbe subject to penalties. The new rules would call to question the finality\\nof all power market transactions and invite buyers to walk away from\\npurchase obligations, Dynegy says. About $100 billion in merchant\\ngeneration investment could be shelved if the FERC proceeds with a\\nproposed new rule, Dynegy warned saying all generation investment would be\\nexposed to a regulatory risk that did not exist before. In December, the\\nFERC delayed implementation of the new rules for several months until a\\ntechnical conference to give companies a chance to offer suggestions.\\nDynegy says id the proposed new rules could also stunt the development of\\nrenewable resources like wind, hydro and solar supplies by requiring them\\nto sell their power at no incremental cost. Entergy has also complained\\nthat the FERC\\'s sweeping changes are not justified by current laws. The\\nFERC is working to design 4 RTOs nationwide with built-in\\nmarket-monitoring capabilities which would negate the need for the new\\nmarket power rules. RTOs with approved monitoring systems will be exempt\\nfrom the new agency order.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nALL BAD NEWS SEEN IN THE MARKET According to a top industry analyst\\ntraders are going to have to bide their time if they expect natural gas\\nprices to get much help from recovering industrial demand. Last week the\\nNAPM (National Association of Purchasing Managers) issued a positive\\nreport concerning industrial activity, but natural gas traders showed\\nlittle interest. \"Industrial demand could be improving slowly, but what is\\ngoing on out there is overshadowed this time of year by weather\\ndevelopments,\" says Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates. \"There\\nshould be some indication of growing industrial demand. The stock market\\nis a leading indicator of industrial activity and those markets are\\nlooking strong, and some of the other indices are looking OK, but for the\\ntime being industrial activity is being buried by other overwhelmingly\\nbearish factors. The forecasts for industrial activity and what goes on in\\nthe natural gas market seem to be a bit tenuous at best. for the next\\ncouple of months the focus is going to be on the weather and once we get\\nto tne end of February, then the industry will focus on industrial\\ndemand.\" \"I do think that all the bad news may be presently factored into\\nthe market. Even though there were new lows made early this week, I think\\nany low prices much below those levels are going to be difficult to\\nsustain,\" he said.

As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. \\n\\nOccupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South\\nYou will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.\\n\\nNEC Monitors\\nThe NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.\\n\\nTurret Users\\nAn \"Alliance MX turret quick reference guide\" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as \"Caller ID\" and \"Voicemail Indication\".\\n\\nIncreased Information Access\\nThere are many NEC 50\" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here\\'s how:\\n\\nTen audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:\\n \\nChannel\\tAvaya\\tStentophon\\t\\nWeather Channel\\t12401\\t801\\t\\nCNN Headlines News\\t12402\\t802\\t\\nCNN Financial News\\t12403\\t803\\t\\nCNBC\\t12404\\t804\\t\\nMSNBC\\t12405\\t805\\t\\nBloomberg\\t12406\\t806\\t\\nFinancial News Network\\t12407\\t807\\t\\nCNN\\t12408\\t808\\t\\nFox Sports\\t12409\\t809\\t\\nESPN1\\t12410\\t810\\t\\n\\n\\nWireless Telephony\\nYou may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network \"in-building\" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  \\n\\nWireless LAN\\nThe infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.\\n\\nAmtel Replacement\\nAs a move to provide a more flexible \"Plug n Play\" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.\\n\\nKeeping an Open forum\\nWe will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com', 'timestamp': '2022-10-17T09:55:14.251542'}}, {'_index': 'enron-index-000001', '_id': '5103', '_score': 0.0, '_ignored': ['text.keyword'], '_source': {'text': \"Message-ID: <8979531.1075852794539.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\\nDate: Fri, 5 Oct 2001 10:14:18 -0700 (PDT)\\nFrom: 40enron@enron.com\\nSubject: Email Retention Policy\\nMime-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\nX-From: Enron Global Technology@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Global+20Technology+40ENRON@ENRON.com>\\nX-To: All Enron Employees N America@ENRON\\nX-cc: \\nX-bcc: \\nX-Folder: \\\\JTOWNSE (Non-Privileged)\\\\Inbox\\nX-Origin: Townsend-J\\nX-FileName: JTOWNSE (Non-Privileged).pst\\n\\nThis is a reminder of Enron's Email retention policy.

The March contract gained $0.123\\nto $2.746 per MMBtu. A flurry of buying started early in the session, a\\nreaction in part to Thursday\\'s liquidation on the January contract\\nexpiration. Clearing the books of Enron-related hedging losers in time for\\nyear-end could also be playing a role in Friday\\'s rally. Some of the\\nvolatility over the past month has been triggered by larger books\\nbalancing their hedges. Enron\\'s demise has forced counter-parties to\\nrecontract supplies, pushing the market with offers or with bids.\\nShuffling monthly spreads from fall to winter and balancing volumes bought\\nat higher prices during the summer for storage will also trickle to a stop\\nmid-January as some storage operators call for contracted withdrawals. The\\nAGA will again delay its release of last week\\'s storage data until\\nThursday because of the holidays.

Shareholders are using this year\\'s filings to try\\nto make sure other companies don\\'t go the same way as Enron. What is new\\nthis year is the auditor independence proposals. Pension funds affiliated\\nwith the United Brotherhood of Carpenters union have filed 12 proposals\\ncalling on companies not to hire the same accounting firm to do both audit\\nand non-audit work. Enron, paid Andersen $52 million in 2000 for both\\naudit and non-audit services, a dual relationship that has raised\\nquestions about Andersen\\'s judgment. The proposals are part of an annual\\nflood that hits companies around the end of year. Their goal is to be\\nincluded in the company\\'s proxy statement, which is mailed to all\\nshareholders, as an item to be brought to the floor of the company\\'s\\nannual meeting for a vote. If companies want to exclude qualified\\nproposals from their proxies, they need approval from the SEC. In 2001 the\\nSEC handled 438 requests from companies for permission to exclude\\nshareholder proposals from their proxies.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nZiff Energy Group presents\\nGas Storage 2002\\nRedefining the Fundamentals:\\nIs Gas Still in the Storage Game?\\nPower Drives Storage\\nWill the recession affect plant and storage development?\\nWill record high volumes in storage further depress gas prices?\\nIs it possible to mitigate storage risk while dealing with year-round\\nprice\\nvolatility?\\nPlus\\nTwo Important Workshops\\nCalpine Corporation\\nHear what the Power Generator wants from the storage industry\\nBruce Bernard\\nLearn from the expert how to mitigate storage price risk in the 2002 gas\\nmarketplace\\nFebruary 6 & 7\\nHouston\\nFour Season Hotel\\n1300 Lamar Street\\nRegister Today for this Important Conference\\nCall 1-800-853-6252\\n\\nEmail: gasconference@ziffenergy.com\\n\\nVisit: www.ziffenergyconferences.com\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nToday\\'s Power Bulletins\\n * AltaGas Services Partner TransCanada Energy Closed Purchase of 706 MW\\nSundance B Power Purchase Arrangement\\n * Bankruptcy Court Approves Enron Wind Development Sale of Indian Mesa\\nand Clear Sky Wind Power Generating Plants in West Texas,  for $175\\nmillion to AEP\\n * Settlement Reached on Sale of Montana Power\\'s Utility to NorthWestern\\nCorporation as Well as Electric Restructuring Costs\\n * DB Alex Brown Cuts 2001 and 2002 Earnings Estimates for Allegheny\\nEnergy\\n * US to Help Russia on Nuclear Control\\n * Northeast and Mid Continent Spot Power Prices Drop from Low Holiday\\nDemand\\n * Southeast Spot Power Prices Fall Ahead of New Years Holiday\\n * Western Power Prices Rise on Holiday Weekend Risk Premiums\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nGet familiar with oil-gasoline.com, inc.

The costs are aimed at offsetting\\nexpenses for building generating plants and related regulatory financing\\nplans prior to deregulation. As natural gas prices soared a year ago, the\\nPUC alleged that TXU and other Texas utilities had no stranded costs\\nrelated to generating assets because of the large amount of natural gas\\nfired generation in the state. Climbing prices made natural gas fired\\nplants almost as costly to operate as nuclear plants. If the settlement is\\napproved by the PUC, TXU will return $350 million to retail electric\\nsuppliers over 2 years by providing credits on transmission and\\ndistribution rates. TXU said it may take a charge of less than $50 million\\nin the 4th quarter because of the settlement. TXU also said it would\\neliminate any remaining stranded costs related to its Comanche Peak\\nnuclear station. TXU also proposes that the PUC authorize it to issue $500\\nmillion in bonds in early 2002 and $800 million after 2003 related to the\\nutility\\'s regulatory assets or previous financing agreements approved by\\nthe PUC. The settlement also cuts a possible penalty to $90 per customer\\nfrom $150 in the event TXUs retail affiliate retains more than 60% of its\\ncustomers after the first 2 years of competition.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n        GET REAL about energy risk management with KWI\\n\\nIn today\\'s fast moving energy markets you need to be able to manage risk\\nin real time.\\n\\nThat means knowing before you hit a risk problem, not afterwards when it\\nmay be too late to prevent big losses spreading right through your\\nenterprise.\\n\\nWith kW3000(tm), our multi-commodity, integrated front to back office\\nsoftware, you can monitor your Profit At Risk(tm), counterparty risk and\\nmark-to-market all in real time.\\n\\nKeep alert to risk.

The\\nproject will include about 42 wind turbines, each producing about 1.5 MW.\\nThe 65 MW facility will utilize the latest wind turbine technology and\\nwill be the largest commercial wind energy facility in the eastern US. The\\nproject is expected to be operational by December 2002. It will\\ninterconnect with the Allegheny Power System in the PJM West RTO and will\\nbe integrated with the PJM RTO. Earlier this year, Power Team signed\\n20-year purchase agreements for 9 MW from the Somerset Wind Power Project,\\n15 MW from the Mill Run Wind Project and 52 MW from the Moosic Mountain\\nWind Farm near Scranton. This agreement brings Power Team\\'s wind portfolio\\nto 144 MW. The Backbone Mountain Wind Project will add to the amount of\\nclean energy available to customers in the PJM territory. Community Energy\\nand Power Team are jointly marketing the output of wind projects. Large\\ncommercial customers, such as the University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie\\nMellon University, Penn State University, Philadelphia Suburban Water\\nCompany and Giant Eagle Foods, have already purchased wind energy from\\nPower Team and Community Energy for periods from 15 years. Power Team\\'s\\ncurrent renewable supply portfolio includes wind, landfill gas,\\nhydroelectric, and biomass generation.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nENERGY JOB LISTINGS\\nWhether you are actively looking for a job, or want to explore\\nopportunities in the energy industry, go to http://www.energyjobs.com.

It will spark the development of a competitive\\nregional power market in the Midwest, of particular importance to\\nenergy-intensive Midwestern states, according to a customer coalition\\nactive in the federal arena. The Coalition of Midwest Transmission\\nCustomers and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio, stated that FERC\\'s\\ndecision paves the way for actual implementation of plans to get a truly\\nindependent entity for the Midwest transmission grid, that encompasses\\ntwenty states and Manitoba, Canada, up and running. The coordination so\\ncritical to system reliability and Ohio\\'s business and industry can now\\nproceed on a timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition\\nof problems we saw a couple of summers ago.  Because the Midwest economy\\nis so energy-intensive, the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue with\\ndevelopment at a challenging pace since an effective regional marketplace\\nwill benefit not only residential users but also Midwestern businesses in\\ntheir efforts to thrive in the worldwide marketplace. The FERC Order also\\nfound that creation of the Alliance RTO does not satisfy scope and\\nconfiguration requirements spelled out in FERC\\'s Order 2000. The\\nCommission made plain that the Alliance companies could continue with the\\nformation of the for-profit Transco, but under the Midwest ISO umbrella.\\nThe significance of this, is that the FERC is focusing on the importance\\nof a single organization as opposed to its form. From the perspective of\\nmarket participants, both buyers and sellers, this and other recent FERC\\ndecisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and competitive\\nmarketplace is the goal for the industry. FERC\\'s November 20th orders\\npreventing several utilities from using their market-pricing authority in\\nareas where they have market power is as critical to nurturing an\\neffective market as the order for a single Midwest RTO.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n  Exploit the enterprise-wide transaction management power deployed by the\\nbig names in gas.\\nNUCLEUS Software\\nZAINET Gasmaster\\nThe most comprehensive, totally-integrated natural gas information system\\navailable today.\\nAsk about out limited-time offer competitive upgrade program.\\nCAMINUS\\nYour Competitive Edge in Energy.\\nCall Caminus at (212)515-3700 or visit the website at www.caminus.com\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nPOWER FUTURES\\n| Month |   COB   | Change |   PV    | Change |\\n| FEB   |  24.75  | +0.00  |  24.75  | +0.00  |\\n| MAR   |  22.00  | +0.00  |  22.00  | +0.00  |\\n| APR   |  21.25  | +0.00  |  21.25  | +0.00  |\\n| MAY   |  23.20  | +0.00  |  23.30  | +0.00  |\\n| JUN   |  22.00  | +0.00  |  22.00  | +0.00  |\\n| JUL   |  34.75  | +0.00  |  34.75  | +0.00  |\\n| AUG   |  44.00  | +0.00  |  44.00  | +0.00  |\\n| SEP   |  39.75  | +0.00  |  39.75  | +0.00  |\\n| OCT   |  30.75  | +0.00  |  30.75  | +0.00  |\\n| NOV   |  33.00  | +0.00  |  30.00  | +0.00  |\\n| DEC   |  35.00  | +0.00  |  30.00  | +0.00  |\\n| JAN   |  33.00  | +0.00  |  30.75  | +0.00  |\\n| Month | Entergy | Change | Cinergy | Change |\\n| FEB   |  25.00  | +0.00  |  25.40  | +0.00  |\\n| MAR   |  23.00  | +0.00  |  25.00  | +0.00  |\\n| APR   |  23.00  | +0.00  |  25.00  | +0.00  |\\n| MAY   |  26.00  | +0.00  |  28.00  | +0.00  |\\n| JUN   |  33.75  | +0.00  |  27.25  | +0.00  |\\n| JUL   |  44.10  | +0.00  |  49.00  | +0.00  |\\n| AUG   |  44.10  | +0.00  |  49.00  | +0.00  |\\n| SEP   |  24.50  | +0.00  |  25.75  | +0.00  |\\n| OCT   |  24.00  | +0.00  |  25.00  | +0.00  |\\n| NOV   |  24.00  | +0.00  |  25.00  | +0.00  |\\n| DEC   |  24.00  | +0.00  |  25.00  | +0.00  |\\n| JAN   |  27.00  | +0.00  |  28.25  | +0.00  |\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nPower Futures\\n| Month |  PJM  | Change |\\n| FEB   | 30.00 | +0.00  |\\n| MAR   | 28.00 | +0.00  |\\n| APR   | 28.00 | +0.00  |\\n| MAY   | 31.50 | +0.00  |\\n| JUN   | 41.50 | +0.00  |\\n| JUL   | 55.60 | +0.00  |\\n| AUG   | 55.60 | +0.00  |\\n| SEP   | 28.00 | +0.00  |\\n| OCT   | 26.75 | +0.00  |\\n| NOV   | 26.75 | +0.00  |\\n| DEC   | 26.75 | +0.00  |\\n| JAN   | 32.00 | +0.00  |\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission\\n\\nNYMEX Natural Gas Futures\\nReportable Positions as of  12/21/01\\n\\nOpen Interest: 422,398                                  10,000 MMBtu\\n\\n                                                       Nonreportable\\nNon-Commercial         |   Commercial |     Total    | Positions\\nLong | Short| Spreading| Long | Short | Long | Short | Long  | Short\\n9,591 36,465   29,975  353,831 342,373 393,397 398,913 29,001  23,485\\n\\nChanges from 12/14/01                Change in Open Interest: -11,137\\n2,924 -2,009    2,324  -12,711  -5,760  -7,463  -5,445 -3,674  -5,692\\n\\nPercent of Open Interest for Each Category of Traders\\n  2.3    8.6      7.1     83.8    78.7   93.1     94.4     6.9    5.6\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis advertisement will be viewed over 10 million times during the year.\\nIt\\nwill be seen on our web and in the 35,000 emails sent out each business\\nday.\\nA 3x 4.5 ad space or banner on the web which includes 15 lines in the text\\nversion, begins at $1000 for the entire month.

In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.\\n\\nFollowing are the highlights of our businesses:\\n\\nWholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).\\nAmericas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).\\nEurope and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.\\n\\nRetail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.\\n\\n\\nTransportation and Distribution:\\n\\tNatural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.\\nPortland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.\\nGlobal Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.\\n\\nBroadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.\\n\\nCorporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.\\n\\nIn addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:\\n?\\tA $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.\\n?\\t$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.\\n?\\t$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  \\n\\nWith our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.\\n \\nWe are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.\\n \\nIf you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.\\n \\nThank you for your support.\\n \\nEnron Global Technology\\n \\n \\n \\n-----Original Message----- \\nFrom: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration \\nSent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM \\nTo: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON \\nCc: \\nSubject: Supported Internet Email Addresses\\n\\n\\n\\nEnron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.\\n\\nAny new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.\\n\\nTo determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.\\n\\nIMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.\\n\\nWe will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.\\n\\nThank you for participation, cooperation and support. \\n\\nEnron Messaging Administration', 'timestamp': '2022-10-17T09:55:14.329036'}}, {'_index': 'enron-index-000001', '_id': '5222', '_score': 0.0, '_ignored': ['text.keyword'], '_source': {'text': 'Message-ID: <17551329.1075852792922.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\\nDate: Sun, 28 Oct 2001 20:23:22 -0800 (PST)\\nFrom: no.address@enron.com\\nSubject: Enron in Action 10.29.01\\nMime-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\nX-From: Enron In Action@ENRON\\nX-To: All Enron Houston@ENRON\\nX-cc: \\nX-bcc: \\nX-Folder: \\\\JTOWNSE (Non-Privileged)\\\\Inbox\\nX-Origin: Townsend-J\\nX-FileName: JTOWNSE (Non-Privileged).pst\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnron in Action can be accessed through the new Community Relations web site at http://cr.enron.com/eia.html .
