To run simply go to launch.bndrun and press the Run OSGi button

Then access either the timetable or icalendar. (valid names must already have been generated by the corresponding generator.)

Some examples:
http://localhost:8080/timetable/model.xmi/Artificial%20Intelligence
http://localhost:8080/icalendar/model.xmi/Artificial%20Intelligence

TODO: fix path of css and js in order to load timetables properly (change html generated to use absolute path or change every necessary file to this folder to easier access).
