The transformation works, but it took me some time to make it work. There were some wrong headers in the utils.mtl file, I think you forgot to commit the latest changes maybe. The transformation is however very well organized, with a good use of templates and especially queries. I liked the use you do of Java services, they are appropriate for those kind of tasks. The project setup could be improved. You submitted only the project with the transformation, with an .ecore file inside that. That is not enough, to make the transformation (reliably) work, because the entire .ecore project with the metamodel is needed. I then had to import the old project from Assignment 1.
